Atlas is an open source game manager and launcher for Windows and Linux with a modern interface for viewing, finding, and easily installing 3rd party games and visual novels.
We currently support adding games from [F95Zone](https://f95zone.to/) and [DLSite](https://www.dlsite.com/) and plan on adding more sources as the project progresses (See features below).
It's meant to replace [Game-List](www.game-list.org) ([Github](https://github.com/game-list/game-list)) but also expand on it's feature set.

Atlas is for the user that wants ease of use, quality of life and have the software do the heavy lifting for you.
